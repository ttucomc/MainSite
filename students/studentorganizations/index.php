      <li><strong>About:</strong><br /> The Advertising Team at Texas Tech is a group of students selected by interview to compete in a national student advertising competition. The annual competition is put on by the American Advertising Federation and features a corporate client. Past clients have included Glidden paints, Coca Cola, JCPenney, Yahoo, and State Farm. The client provides a case study outlining the history of its product and current advertising situation. The case study reflects a real world situation to challenge students' critical thinking abilities and creativity. Students must research the product and its competition, identify potential problems and develop an integrated communications campaign for the client. Each student team then pitches its campaign to a panel of judges in April.</li>
