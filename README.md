We here on the marketing team had an idea for our site. We were needing a way for our team to collaborate together on the various pages of our site and GitHub was our obvious choice. We started to make the repo private but then we thought, what if one of our students, or anyone for that matter, had a brilliant idea to add to the site? Lets let them and give them a way to show us!

With that being said, we have this repo for two reasons:
1. For our team to collaborate
2. To collaborate with anyone else that cares
So feel free to contribute in any way you want!

## This is not our whole site

The pages on this site are new pages or old pages that we are revamping, so it's not our entire [site](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/comc). One day it may be, but Texas Tech has us operating under the CMS OmniUpdate and there's no good way to push these files to our live site. We get to copy and paste *woohoo*. Here we will continue to add directories and pages as we get to them and revamp them.
