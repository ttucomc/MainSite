            <p>Former faculty member in the College of Media and Communication, Ralph Sellmeyer passed away at his home Monday, February 27, 2017. Sellmeyer was 92. He joined the Texas Tech faculty in 1960. He earned a B.J. from the University of Missouri and an M.A. from Missouri, Kansas City. Sellmeyer served as editor and advertising manager of the Baldwin Ledger (Kansas). Sellmeyer was also the feature writer, photographer and editor of the Parade of Progress for 10 years. At Tech, he served as managing editor and advertising manager for the Texas Techsan. He belonged to national professional advertising fraternities and was editor of the ADS magazine.</p>
            <p>Sellmeyer was a key member of Dr. Billy Ross’ initial administration in creating the Department of Mass Communication. He was also the motivating force in creating and developing the department’s public relations sequence and forming the student chapter of the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA – March 1973). The chapter was eventually named the Sellmeyer-Henderson Chapter of PRSSA honoring Sellmeyer and Jerry Henderson, who served as associate director and public relations director for the Lubbock United Way.</p>
            <p>After serving the Texas Tech University for 21 years, Sellmeyer resigned his faculty position in 1981 to become the Alision Professor of Journalism at Midland College in Midland, Texas. At Tech, he served as associate chairperson, headed the divisions of journalism and advertising, as well as the public relations sequences. During his tenure, he taught more than 30 different courses.</p>
            <p>In his letter of resignation to Ross, Sellmeyer wrote: “I am justifiably proud of the Department that you and I have built at Texas Tech under the leadership of two talented and dedicated chairmen - you and Wallace Garets. I am unashamedly proud of the role I had in developing the program to the point it is today. My chief regret in leaving was not seeing school status come to fruition. But it will eventually come to pass.” Some 23 years later, the department, with assistance from key donors and the administrative support of Provost Bill Marcy, became the College of Mass Communication – now the College of Media &amp; Communication.</p>
            <p>I am thankful for Ralph’s contributions and leadership in developing an excellent program at Texas Tech University, but mostly for his friendship to me.</p>

            <h3>Media Strategies Alum Discusses Prestigious Advertising Career</h3>
            <p class="author">By <a href="https://plus.google.com/112189571714291024979" rel="author">Rachel Blevins</a></p>
            <figure><img title="Jake Quintanilla" src="/comc/about/publications/converging/2017/images/march/JakeQuintanilla1.jpg" alt="Jake Quintanilla" /><figcaption>Jake Quintanilla</figcaption></figure>
            <p>After Jake Quintanilla graduated from the Texas Tech University College of Media &amp; Communication in May 2015, he put his degree in media strategies to work by making a name for himself in the world of advertising.</p>
            <p>“After graduation my career kind of took off at an unexpected rate,” Quintanilla said. “I moved to New York for the summer where I worked with Havas Worldwide before I moved to Chicago in October with DigitasLBi as an account executive.”</p>
            <p>Originally from Ropesville, Texas, Quintanilla’s career comprises work with some of the country’s top advertising agencies, including Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, Deutsch, Havas Worldwide, Weiden &amp; Kennedy, DigitasLBi and FCB Chicago.</p>
            <p>“As an Account Executive at Digitas, I worked with clients like MillerCoors and Sprint maintaining client relations and working with strategists and creatives to develop content,” Quintanilla said. “FCB Chicago reached out to me and asked if I would work for them. That is how I became an account executive for the State Farm account, officially making me ‘Jake from State Farm.’ Now, seven months later, as FCB continues to grow, I have been tasked with helping to lead and develop a new account won by the agency.”</p>
            <p>In addition to his professional work, Quintanilla said he is also involved with a number of organizations focused around the issues of diversity and inclusion within the advertising industry.</p>
            <p>“I am a board member of the Mosaic Next Generation Leadership Council—an affiliated organization of the American Advertising Federation,” Quintanilla said. “I am also in the middle of a few entrepreneurial&nbsp;business opportunities, one being my own non-profit organization called the Mi Casa Es Su Casa (MCESC) Network. This organization is aimed towards educating, celebrating and representing the Latino and Hispanic community within the advertising, entertainment and technology industries.”</p>
            <p>Rebecca Ortiz, now an assistant advertising professor at Syracuse University, described Quintanilla as one of the most ambitious and thoughtful students she worked with at Texas Tech.</p>
            <p>“When I first met Jake, he was a starry-eyed, eager young undergraduate who just needed to be reminded that he was capable of doing great things, and I was more than happy to give him that encouragement,” Oritz said. “It’s easy to cheer for students who are willing to put in the work and dedicate themselves, and he is a shining example of that. He deserves all of the success he has received, because he worked hard for it.”</p>
            <figure style="float: left; margin: 0 1.5em 1em 0;"><img title="Jake Quintanilla in front of the TTU seal" src="/comc/about/publications/converging/2017/images/march/JakeQuintanilla2.jpg" alt="Jake Quintanilla in front of the TTU seal" /></figure>
            <p>Quintanilla’s experience dates back to his time as a CoMC student, when he pursued internships with Latino Lubbock Magazine, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide New York, RD Thomas Advertising and Havas Worldwide&nbsp;New York. He was also involved with organizations such as Tech Ad Federation and the Texas Tech Ad Team.</p>
            <p>“I really got my start through an organization called MAIP,” Quintanilla said. “The Multicultural Advertising Internship Program kick-started my career by placing me in internships with major advertising agencies like Ogilvy and Havas. Through this program I got to partner with other agencies and companies like Deutsch, Weiden &amp; Kennedy, and Nike. As a participant in MAIP they built us through professional development workshops and networking events to really set us up for success.”</p>
            <p>Geoffrey Graybeal, an assistant public relations professor in CoMC, said Quintanilla was a polished and professional student who was memorable from the time he was the “CEO” of his group’s startup project in Graybeal’s Media Entrepreneurship class.</p>
            <p>“Jake is a gifted presenter and his team's final investor pitch was impressive and memorable,” Graybeal said. “From his internships with the prestigious Multicultural Advertising Internship Program to his course work as a media strategies major and his extracurricular involvement, it has been clear from Jake's time in the College of Media &amp; Communication that he would excel in a media-oriented career.”</p>
            <p>Quintanilla said he would encourage current students to take the time to explore their passions.</p>
            <p>“Focus on being a great student and getting good grades, but don't let that be the only thing you're doing,” Quintanilla said. “It is your experiences, your passions, and your ability to be an expert in other fields which will help you advance not only in your career but in life as well.”</p>
            <p>Ann Rodriguez, an instructor in the Department of Advertising, said she knew Quintanilla was engaging and intelligent from the time they were paired together as mentor and protégé in the MentorTech program.</p>
            <p>“I have had the pleasure of watching this somewhat shy young man grow into a capable and confident communications professional, indeed now creating opportunities for himself and exploring his entrepreneurial side as well,” Rodriguez said.&nbsp;“I am so proud of the professional he has become and look forward to a lifelong personal and professional connection made possible by programs like MentorTech and the College of Media &amp; Communication at Texas Tech University.”</p>

            <h3>Journalism Student Pursues Future in Sports Media</h3>
            <p class="author">By <a href="https://plus.google.com/112189571714291024979" rel="author">Rachel Blevins</a></p>
            <figure><img title="Melodee Gunter" src="/comc/about/publications/converging/2017/images/march/MelodeeGunter1.jpg" alt="Melodee Gunter" /><figcaption>Melodee Gunter</figcaption></figure>
            <p>Growing up in Dimmitt, Texas, sports were an essential part of Melodee Gunter’s life. With her dad as a high school football coach, and her brother as an active athlete, she was always attending one game or another. But she said it wasn’t until she came to college that she realized she could turn her love for sports into a career.</p>
            <p>“There’s nothing like Texas high school football,” Gunter said. “I think when I realized how much I really missed just being around sports all the time, like I always had been up until college, that’s when I realized I wanted to go into sports broadcasting.”</p>
            <p>Now, as a senior journalism major in the Texas Tech University College of Media &amp; Communication, Gunter said she is exploring all of the opportunities that come with a career in sports media.</p>
            <p>“Last football season was when I got my very first taste of reporting,” Gunter said. “I wrote for the website Lonestar Gridiron. I would go to a high school game every Friday and just write the story of the game.”</p>
            <p>Gunter said she also gained experience interning with Fox34 in Lubbock last summer. Sports Director Rob Verby described Gunter as an enthusiastic intern.</p>
            <p>“Melodee was a great intern, eager to learn and listen while presenting herself as a professional each day,” Verby said.</p>
            <p>Gunter is also interning with the website The Old Coach, where she covers high school sports with the help of electronic media major Jordan Hernandez. She said her coverage during the fall included picking five high school games in West Texas to highlight with preview articles, and then attending one of the games for more in-depth coverage.</p>
            <p>“Jordan would video my stand up before the game, he’d shoot some highlights during the game, then after I would grab a player and a coach for post-game interviews,” Gunter said. “It was so much fun and I learned so much from it.”</p>
            <p>This spring, Gunter said she plans to visit different high schools in West Texas for one-on-one interviews with coaches and players.</p>
            <p>“I’m so glad that I’ve gotten so much experience in the West Texas area,” Gunter said. “I can honestly say I’ve never had a bad encounter with any coach or player that I’ve come across.”</p>
            <figure style="float: left; margin: 0 1.5em 1em 0;"><img title="Melodee Gunter interviewing" src="/comc/about/publications/converging/2017/images/march/MelodeeGunter2.jpg" alt="Melodee Gunter interviewing" /></figure>
            <p>CoMC Associate Dean Todd Chambers said his first impression of Gunter was that she was passionate about a career in sports broadcasting. As he has watched her work ethic during her time in the college, he said he is even more convinced that she is on the path to success.</p>
            <p>“I’ll never forget the day I met Melodee,” Chambers said. “She seemed so eager and passionate about wanting to learn more about sports media.&nbsp; I was at a high school football game a few days later and Melodee was there covering the game as a freelancer. From that moment on, I knew she had ‘it’—and that she was going to be famous one of these days!”</p>
