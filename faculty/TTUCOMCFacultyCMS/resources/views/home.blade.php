  {{-- This is where the logged in faculty memeber will see all their related content
        for their page. Here, they can edit their content and submit a request to
          have their changes reviewed. Kuhrt and Justin will then be notified of the
            changes and can approve or deny the request. I am thinking this can be done
              via email with a link to view all changes. --}}
