                    <p><span class="from-the-dean-content-span-drop-letter">A</span> good journalist will tell you that in order to understand facts you need to
                    consider context and history. But sometimes data present such a clear pattern of outcome that little explanation or commentary is needed to draw fairly obvious conclusions from them. Looking back at recent academic years and forward to the new one, this is the case. In brief, we in the college believe that this has been the most productive and spectacular year in our history. We make this claim even while acknowledging the prominent milestones of the recent past, including the formation of our independent college, the creation of the Ph.D. program, the move-in to newly renovated facilities, and the merger with the Communication Studies department.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, like any enterprise, we are judged by a set of metrics – analogous to sales, market share, and customer satisfaction figures. They number in the hundreds, but as for any nonprofit, business, or government agency, some are more important and more revealing than others. So I will simply list, in no particular order, the headline achievements of the college as of the last year and assert that these highlights not only the robust health of CoMC but also, above all, the incredibly talented, hardworking and dedicated team of faculty and staff serving our mission, students and future.</p>
